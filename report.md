# VOIR

This project is a program that performs video analysis of a delimited trajectory for a car replica.
The algorithm runs on a Raspberry Pi, and communicates with an Arduino card that handles the robotic side.

The trajectory is composed of plastic cones.
Red cones are located on the left, and yellow cones on the right of the road.

The algorithm relies heavily on the OpenCV library.
